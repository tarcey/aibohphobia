Fun but unusable perpetually-WIP reversible programming language written in Java. Old code which i haven't worked on in a long while.


1. Guarantee reversibility via correct syntax, which can be checked ahead of time. Permit no loss of reversibility during runtime.
2. Functional reversal can be achieved by mirroring the source-code character-by-character.
3. Just for fun.


Incomplete. The 'loops' are brain-twisters which alone already justify this language's name. Despite having implemented the loops themselves, i have thus far failed at making them do anything useful at all. Regular loops do not naturally translate into reversible languages in such a way that reversibility is guaranteed via syntax, and no loss of reversibility is possible at run-time. Instead, a completely different kind of loop is used here. The loops here are inspired by the question 'What would you do differently if you could do it over again?', where the 'thing' to be done differently is the initial value of a loop variable.

TODO: document this all to explain syntax, and include example code.
